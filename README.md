# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

Created a daily planner that allows the user to enter an event in each timeblock.

Created a save function so that when events entered are saved, they are saved into local storage.

This allows the saved events to remain in the planner when the page is refreshed.

Created a for each loop for the timeblocks to color code them 
based on whether the timeblock is in the past, present, or future. 

Used the Day.js library to display the current date when the planner is opened. 

Learned and applied the jQuery skills to implement a planner that stores and saves events.
